      <h1>iCal Combinator</h1>

      <p>Congratulations! You stumbled across the application for
      combining <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar">iCalendar</a>
      calendars that we carefully try to keep secret as much as
      possible.</p>
      
      <p>However, since you are now are here, we might as well tell you
      what it is all about.</p>

      <h2>What is it all about?</h2>

      <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar">iCalendar</a>
      is marching along quite nicely. The trouble is, you easily end up
      having to track numerous .ical feeds and hook them all up with -
      say - Google Calendar. That's a lot of labour. Time you better
      spend on something a little more interesting.</p>

      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      
      <p>Pretty simple. iCal Combinator allows you to integrate
      calendars from the commandline. It offers a simple restful API for
      merging calendars at will.</p>

      <h2>The Calendars</h2>
      
      <p>In iCal Combinator, every calendar is identified by a URL like
      this:</p>
      <pre>http://ical-combinator.appspot.com/calendars/{key}</pre>
      
      <p>There is no access control, so you if you create your own
      calendar, you better choose your key wisely.</p>

      <h2>Defining a Calendar</h2>

      <p>To create a calendar, simply PUT a list of URLs to iCalendar
      feeds to the calendar location of your preference. That's it.</p>
      
      <h2>Obtaining the definition of your Calendar</h2>
      <p>You can always obtain of a Calendar by performing a GET on the
      Calendar's URL.</p>

      <h2>Obtaining the iCalendar feed</h2>
      <p>... but the interesting stuff is of course to obtain an
      integrated iCalendar feed. There are two ways. Neither one of them
      is particularly complicated, but let's start with the simple one:
      simply do a GET on the location of your Calendar, and append
      '/ical'. So the full URL would be something like this:</p>

      <pre>http://ical-combinator.appspot.com/calendars/{key}/ical</pre>
      
      <p>This way works pretty well, especially if you want to hook your
      iCalendar feed up with some existing tools.</p>

      <p>However, if you are a real restafarian, then you consider the
      approach above one for sissies. Instead, you want the real thing:
      Content Negotiation! Yeah, baby! Now, iCal Combinator supports
      that as well. If you simply do a GET on the calendars URL and pass
      an 'Accept: text/calendar' header, you will get your calendar as
      an integrated calendar feed.</p>
